This code sets up a basic keylogger that captures keystrokes and saves them to a file named "keyfile.txt". It continuously listens for key presses using the pynput library and writes the characters of the pressed keys to the log file. However, note that this code does not handle key release events or special keys like Shift, Ctrl, etc. Also, it does not include error handling for file operations, which should be added for robustness.
